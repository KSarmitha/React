1) What are different types for testing?
    Manual testing
    Automatic testing - write test cases for testing functionality
        its includes , 
            Unit testing (write test cases for a spaecic part (isolated components)), 
            integration testing (writing test cases for connected compoenents), 
            end to end testing (test cases from the user enter to tha application until leaves the page)

2) What is Enzyme?
    Javascript testing utility for React.
    allow 3 different way to render react compoennts in our test: 
        - Shallow rendering
        - Full DOM rendering
        - Static rendering
    Enzyme is dependent on React internals, so apart from the library itself, we need to install an Adapter 
    that is compatible with the version of React in the project.

3) Enzyme vs React Testing Library(RTL)
    The React Testing Library is a very light-weight solution for testing React components. 
    It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, 
    in a way that encourages better testing practices.

    RTL provides only one way of rendering React components which is "render" - equivalent to Enzyme's "mount"

    when a new version of React is released, there is no need to make any changes in the library source code.    

4) What is Jest and why do we use it?
    JS open-source testing framework, allows to write test cases
    RTL uses Jest
