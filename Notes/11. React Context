1) What is prop drilling?
    Pass the prop from parent to its children , then form that children to its children 
    basically , passing down props through multiple layers of nested components

2) What is lifting the state up?
    Pass the controll of state change to parent component.
    moving the state from a lower-level(child-component) to a higher-component(parent or common ancestor)
    in the component tree.

3) What is Context Provider and Context Consumer?
    Context API provides way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass manually at every level
    Context provider:  to update the context value
        its component that allows its children to subscribe to a context's changes.
    Context Consumer: used to get the value from context
        Allows component to access the context data without the need of prop drilling
        <UserContext.Consumer>
            {() => data.name}
        </UserContext.Consumer>
4) If you donâ€™t pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
    if we context is a object it will throw the error , since not to be undefined
    if its have only string, then it will use the default value if we didn't pass the value
