1) useContext vs Redux.
    - both are used for state management
    - useCotext built-in fetaure from React; Redux is an external library
    - Redux will have a learning curve
    useContext will be complex if project components count increase and data read and modify
    between many components, Redux can used to overcome that issue
    useContext can be utilized its features within the mid-level projects
    Redux will help for complex projects

2) Advantage of using Redux Toolkit over Redux
    - No need to install more libraries [@redux/toolkit, react-redux is enough]
    - less bilorplate code
    - Setting up the redux store is easy
    - built in dev tool support 
    - Handles immutability for us by using Immer library internally

3) Explain Dispatcher.
    Term used to refer a function called dispatch.
    use it to send actions to the store
    UserContext.dispatch(updateUserName())

4) Explain Reducer
    combination of reducers
    simplifies the process of defining actions and the corresponding reducer logic
    createSlice function is used to create reducers

5) Explain slice.
    Store is a big object , slice them into a pieces based our need. can be used one slice for cart data
    another splice for user data
    encapsulate the logic related to a specific part of the state

6) Explain selector.
    function extracts specific pieces of data from the store
    compute derived data from the store

7) Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.
    process of creating redux slices, redux slice is a piece of the redux store that 
    includes a set of actions, a reducer and initial state

    const mySlice = createSlice({
        name: '',
        initialState: {
            items: []
        },
        reducers: {
            addAction: () => {}
            removeAction: () => {}
        }
    })

    export const {addAction, removeAction} = mySlice.actions;
    export default mySlice.reduce





Note: Redux support asynchronous actions using middleware like redux-thunk or redux-saga.
Redux toolkit has redux-query to make asynchronous operations
